# Particle Filter Motion Upgrade

This project simulates robot motion using a **particle filter** for state estimation. The core simulation is written in **C++**, and the results are visualized with **Python**.

## üõ† Build and Run Instructions

### 1. Build the C++ Code

Create a build directory and compile the project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### 2. Run the C++ Program

```bash
./particle_filter_motion_upgrade
```

> This will generate output data in a CSV file containing the robot's true trajectory and particle filter estimates.

### 3. Run the Python Plotting Script

From the root project directory:

```bash
python3 plot_trajectory.py
```

This script reads the output data and generates a plot comparing the robot‚Äôs actual and estimated paths.

## üìä Trajectory Plot

Below is an example of the output generated by the Python script:

## üì¶ Python Dependencies

Make sure the following packages are installed:

- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`

Install them using:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user matplotlib pandas numpy
```

If you encounter a **PEP 668** error (externally managed environment), create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install matplotlib pandas numpy
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Build Process Works

1. `cmake ..` configures the project using `CMakeLists.txt`.
2. `make` compiles the C++ source files into an executable.
3. The executable simulates robot motion using a particle filter and generates trajectory data.
4. `plot_trajectory.py` visualizes the output by plotting the true path vs. the estimated path.

## üîß Motion Model Upgrade Explained

This project features an **upgraded motion model** for the particle filter:

- Uses a **velocity-based motion model** with separate rotational and translational components.
- Injects **Gaussian noise** into motion to simulate real-world uncertainty.
- Leads to improved trajectory estimation over naive or idealized motion models.

This makes the simulation more realistic and prepares the particle filter for use in real-world robotics scenarios.
