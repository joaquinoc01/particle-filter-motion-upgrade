# Particle Filter Motion Upgrade

This project simulates robot motion using a **particle filter** for state estimation. The core simulation is written in **C++**, and the results are visualized with **Python**.

## 🛠 Build and Run Instructions

### 1. Build the C++ Code

Create a build directory and compile the project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### 2. Run the C++ Program

```bash
./particle_filter_motion_upgrade
```

> This will generate output data in a CSV containing the robot trajectory and filter estimates.

### 3. Run the Python Plotting Script

From the root project directory:

```bash
python3 plot_trayectory.py
```

This script reads the output data from the build folder and generates a plot of the robot’s actual and estimated paths.

## 📊 Trajectory Plot

Below is an example of the output generated by the Python script:

## 📦 Python Dependencies

Make sure the following packages are installed:

- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`

Install them using:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user matplotlib pandas numpy
```

If you encounter a `PEP 668` error (externally managed environment), use a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install matplotlib pandas numpy
```

## ⚙️ How the Build Process Works

1. `cmake ..` sets up the build system using `CMakeLists.txt`.
2. `make` compiles the C++ source files and creates an executable.
3. The executable simulates the robot's motion and generates trajectory data.
4. `plot_trayectory.py` reads the data and plots the real vs estimated trajectory.
